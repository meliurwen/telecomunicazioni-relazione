## Implementation of a firewall functionality using SDN with a OpenFlow architecture

Written in Italian, in this essay are presented some firewall functions
implemented through a Software-defined Network architecture using an OpenFlow
protocol analyzing the possible advantages and implications that can derive in
both security and in network management.

## Performances of firewalls built with dedicated appliances: dependency on the number of rules and possible optimizations

Written in Italian, based on the prototype of an SDN-enabled (stateful) hardware
firewall that uses OpenFlow as a communication protocol. It focuses on the
impact that the number of rules applied on a firewall can have on performances
and discuss the possible practices to be adopted or avoided) to mitigate such
issues.
